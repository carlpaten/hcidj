- Measure slider knob stem dimensions and fix labels

VISIO:
- FX unit: we think that the “select” functionality should be better labeled and separated from the knobs+buttons (“using” functionality). 
	-maybe remove the second set of arrows, and make the first set of arrows undirected (just lines). 
	-add the word “select” somewhere
	-basically make it look more obvious for the user (what button does what)
- Fix left FX (fx1,2,3) labels
- Fix left and right “filter” labels
- Put space between REC LED and label
- Fix left and right “TREBLE” labels
- Add “L” and “R” labels for cue buttons


DONE? - Get diffused LEDs for square buttons
- Cut backing piece for pressure strip - this should be cut out of a panel.
- Cut big square PCB and silicon cover at workshop for select buttons. (cut to 4x2)

CHECK - Triple-check screw hole sizes. Each hole should be exactly the size of the major diameter of the screw.
- screw lengths and washers (make a BOM):
	- Small slider needs 15mm stem + 4mm hole + 1mm washer + 1/4" panel thickness, M2
	- Large slider needs 14mm stem + 5mm hole + 1mm washer + 1/4" panel thickness, M3
	- LED stick needs 1mm washer + 1/4 inch panel thickness + nut, M2
	- and button grids need screws too

- 74HC595 for multiplexing LEDs, or any other shift register with serial input and parallel output.
